<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# 📖 About This Project <a name="about-project"></a>

> This project is built using Angular, leveraging the latest version along with SCSS for styling. It incorporates advanced features such as @if and @for directives, along with other functionalities like pipes and reusable components. Designed as part of a job interview challenge, it showcases meticulous styling and organization. The seamless routing ensures smooth navigation between pages without unnecessary page reloads. Utilizing RxJS, the project employs reactive programming akin to React Redux Toolkit, streamlining data management for enhanced code cleanliness and efficiency. Moreover, the implementation of @defer optimizes page loading, embracing lazy loading for improved performance.

# SlidingPuzzle

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.3.2.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.

## Further help
